It is Fail RP to run away from a crime and enter the green zone to avoid RP but police station is excluded from this rule. If the RP begins outside of it and is brought into the green zone, you may continue the criminal RP, however, it must be realistic. An example, in which it is not allowed is bringing a gang vs gang fight to the Hospital or Police station.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    NLR (New-Life Rule): If your character is down and has received injuries that cannot be saved (e.g. Burnt, drowned in ocean for a long time etc.) you have to respawn. you will not have the memory of the cause of your death.
                    <br>
                    When a new life starts, your character will forget all the information and events leading up to your death. However, you are still the same character (you will have your same job, gang, friends).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You cannot return to the ongoing/current RP scenario if you have respawned or revived.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>Letting Medic Know: (Using /me)</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If You were killed in a way where you cannot be revived or burned, please let the medics know in RP. 
                    For example, /me was shot in the head multiple times and has no pulse, /me burned, /me committed suicide. 
                    Using /me to convey that you should not be revived is mandatory. 
                    Even if Medic fails to see that and revives you mistakenly, you should follow NLR (New Life Rule) mentioned above. 
                    /me should be using when medic is checking your body condition about your injury for example if you are down by accident and got injured in legs use /me injured in legs to cooperate EMS Roleplay. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>When you are down:</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You are allowed to send distress signal to Ems and You cannot communicate with anyone while you are down, especially not giving any information to your teammates. 
                    Usage of radio/3rd party communication for speaking after you are down is considered as Fail RP.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>When you are revived:</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you have been revived, you will gain your memory in 2 mins disregard NLR. However, you shall RP your injury for at least 5 mins like trying to gain your memory or acting like you are injured in your head - this depends on the injury as well. 
                    If you are planning a Revenge RP after got revived, you have to wait for 30 OOC mins (Cool down Time). 
                    Also, the character should not go back to the same location for the cool down time mentioned above.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your character remembers all the information before they were downed
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Do not force respawn during RP situations. 
                    Remember you are still in RP. For example, If you are down in a robbery scenario and police is waiting for medic you should not force re-spawn as the scenario is not over yet. 
                    This will lead to ban
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>NO COMBAT LOGGING:</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you are in the middle of an RP scenario or if you're down in a fight do not log out this is considered as combat logging.
                    <br>
                    If your game crashes in the middle of a RP scenario you can continue the scenario by logging in again or inform in discord about it to the persons involved in the RP.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are caught by the police or in the middle of any scenario, your game crashes you have to continue the scenario by logging in again by contacting the concern person through OOC chat in-game. If not possible, notify in discord to concern department in OOC chat. 
                    <br>
                    If you have initiated a scenario and just missed eyesight from police or civilian, you are not allowed to quit the game immediately you should wait at least 5 minutes in a hideout before storing the vehicle in the garage.

                <br>
                <h1>COPS/EMS</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If there are only three cop/ems on duty, you are not supposed to kidnap the cop/ems.
                    <br>
                    HOWEVER, if a cop/ems put themselves in danger, this rule will not be applicable since it has happened due to their own fault.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>No cop/EMS baiting:</h2>Do not purposefully try and get police/EMS attention on you by doing things you would not do with an officer near you. You cannot constantly target the cop/ems when they are on duty.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Use of Player List Menu:</h2>
                    All citizens shall act like there are always cops present inside the city and do RP accordingly. 
                    Using Player List Menu information and take RP advantage is considered as fail RP and should be avoided.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                    <h2>Supress Fire or verbal warning about the action:</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Killing a person without any Role-play initiated on a particular scenario is considered as RDM.  Killing a person should be done only if there is a valid reason behind it. Supress fire is shooting in the air or in the ground without hitting the opposite party just to warn them that you are going to shoot them. Suppress fire should be used if you are not able to communicate and warn then verbally to give time for the opposite party to react whether to surrender or escape or to fight back. After a supress fire the opposite party must be given 5-10 secs time to take cover, surrender or to react. If you are not able to warn verbally then it is mandatory to use a suppress fire. This is applicable for both civilians. Even after a police chase in robbery also suppress fire rule to be followed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Examples:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    1.      If you are in your gang place and person is using your gang garage for storing vehicle immediately you cannot shoot for using your gang garage. You can inform him that you should not use the garage if he cooperates and leave the area then there is no need of killing him or shooting him.  If he refuses to obey your order, then you have to verbally warn him that I will shoot you if use our garage and you can give him a deadline like I will give to 20 secs to clear the area or I will shoot or you can. Even after this warning if he is still in the area then you may shoot him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2.      When you are in a on foot police chase and police see a weapon in your hand then they have to verbally communicate to you they will shoot or they can give supress fire before shooting at you.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Police VS Civilians:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    1.      If a police is in a robbery situation or other RP situation other civilians are not allowed to interfere or start a RP with that particular police.
                <br>
                <br>    
                    2.      Don't talk to police about the Police Rules or Don't police the police.
                    <br>
                <br>
                    3.      After finishing the robbery if police didn't respond then you are free to go.
                    <br>
                <br>
                    4.      If you are in a robbery situation and only one police come to attend the Scenario, then you should negotiate properly as if you are fully surrounded by police and leave the area after the police allows you to go.
                    <br>
                <br>
                    5.      Hostage life is more important to robbers than the police don't think about the OOC rule that only 5 police will be outside we can shoot the hostage and shoot the police and escape. Think that all the police have surrounded you and negotiate with police with the hostage.

                        If the Hostage is shot down to death or if the robbery takes place without Hostage in any police scenario including robberies, all the police will respond in that scenario
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Civilians or police or doctor should not be kidnapped in front of  a police.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Robbers should avoid considering PD as a gang, they belong to the Police Department and that is it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Robbers should avoid showing PD the same toxicity they show to the other gangs. If nobody is there on PD side, there wont be any RP for Robbers and gangs
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The word  " Gang " carries a different kind of weight. it shouldn't be mentioned to PD so often. i.e. A robber caught and being processed by PD shouldn't say things like " I will call my gang if you increase my jail sentence or issue more fines ".
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Robberies are different from Gang RP. Stop involving your gang in everything.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If a Police officer calls you for a traffic stop, either stop and answer or just plainly try to get away. Avoid doing things like calling backup from your gang members or taking them to your gang place just to shoot them along with your gangmates, It will come under Cop-Baiting.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Show some respect to PD, They are also players just like you. Saying things like, "Go call another higher grade officer".
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        PD have their own RP. Stop pushing them to process you faster. They can and will take their own time in processing you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Don't talk about PD rules to PD. If you feel something is unfair, take it to OOC by raising a ticket.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "PD ATTACK" has a certain weight to it. Stop attacking PD for silly reasons like more jail time, more fines and false reasons like they asked you to remove your clothes. After any PD Attack, The group who attacked will be called in OOC and the reason will be asked.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you are in your 2nd Character and your first character is in PD. Show PD the same attitude and respect that you expect from robbers when you are in your 1st character.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Try to build some RP in any situation, Shooting should be your last option, not the first.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Avoid doing robberies just so you can go camp somewhere and shoot PD.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Do not bring OOC reason for IC things.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you shoot somewhere, own up to it ( Do RP ). Don't plainly say it's a bug or that you just entered the city.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Same applies to Traffic stop for rash driving or speeding. Don't say it is due to network, lag, desync or ping problems. Own up to it. Even if it is due to OOC reasons as mentioned above, you will be fines or punished accordingly.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If your items has been stolen in the game, it won't be refunded back. It will be considered as an act of RP.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Items will not be refunded if they are stored before the restart of 10-15 minutes and are lost.</p>
